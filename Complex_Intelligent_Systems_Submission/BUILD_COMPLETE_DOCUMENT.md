#### 3. Discussion Section - Expand:
Currently only has 2 short paragraphs. Original has detailed discussion including:
- [ ] Pattern analysis (temporal, spatial regularities)
- [ ] Aggregation strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Rank selection mechanism discussion
- [ ] Limitations discussion (normal traffic extraction, attack types, aggregation trade-offs)
- [ ] Mechanistic explanations
- [ ] Methodological comparisons with literature
- [ ] Alternative explanations consideration

## Recommendation for Completion:

Due to the massive amount of missing content (especially 15+ figures with detailed analysis), I recommend:

1. **Manual completion** using the original Project.tex as reference
2. **OR** Break into smaller incremental updates focusing on one subsection at a time
3. **OR** I can create a comprehensive script that adds ALL missing content in one go (will require multiple file operations)

Would you like me to proceed with option 3 - creating the complete document systematically by adding all missing equations, figures, tables, and text?
